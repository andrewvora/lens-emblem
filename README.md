Looking up IVs is such a hassle. Let's fix that.

## Set Up

### Crashlytics

This app uses Crashlytics to report crashes. 
For it to work, you will need a valid `google-services.json` in the `app/` directory.

## Scripts

We have some scripts for scrapping hero data. These depend on Node v8.+.

These scripts are used by a Jenkins job to update the hero data weekly.
